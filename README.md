# Image-Classification-Notebook

In this notebook the objective was to write a new CNN model which would learn from the train data provided and predict the class labels for the images in the test data. For this goal, I used several techniques such as data preprocessing, data augmentation, L2 regularization, sequential CNN building (in which I worked with hyperparameters as relu and leakyrelu activations, adam optimizer/ learning rate, layers and filter sizes, batch normalization and Flatten). I used plots and confusion matrix to visualize what I am working with and looked at my augmented images to see if they are distorted or not. After many trials on fine tuning I concluded with using transfer learning which gave the most precise results.
